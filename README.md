FiestC (like fiesty)
---
A project combining [a modified FiThree](https://github.com/bainchild/FiThree), some future project like yueliang but for lua 5.3,  
[lilac](https://github.com/bainchild/lilac), [and it's runtime](https://github.com/bainchild/lilac_runtime)
to build AND INTEGRATE C lua modules into pure lua code, to achieve true lua portability bliss.
Still mostly unimplemented, + a lot of bugs (probably), but so far, I've gotten this to work:

<sub>also it'd be cool to make a luajit ffi library equivalent.</sub>
